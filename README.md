# ⚽ 3D Soccer Game Simulation (WebGL + Three.js)

This is a browser-based 3D soccer game built using **Three.js** and **Vanilla JavaScript**. The player controls a character on a dynamic soccer field, aiming to score goals while avoiding AI-controlled defenders. The game includes features like music toggling, dual camera views (first-person and third-person), agent-based opponents, and realistic bump-mapped textures for the pitch.

## 🌟 Features

- 🧠 **AI Opponents** — Agents with unique strategies (chasing or defending).
- 🎮 **Player Controls** — Use `WASD` to move and `Space` to kick the ball.
- 🎵 **Dynamic Music System** — Randomized background tracks with toggle.
- 🏞️ **Textured Environment** — Bump-mapped grass pitch and stadium banners.
- 🎥 **Camera Toggle** — Switch between third-person and immersive first-person views.
- ⏱️ **Countdown Timer** — 60 seconds to score as many goals as possible.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Three.js** for 3D rendering
- **JavaScript** (no frameworks)
- **HTML/CSS** for layout
- **WebGL** for hardware-accelerated graphics
